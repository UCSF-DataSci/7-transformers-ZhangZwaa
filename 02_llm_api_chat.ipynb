    "   - [ ] Handle API errors gracefully\n",

    "   - [ ] Handle errors and edge cases\n",

    "3. **Command Line Interface**:\n",
    "   - [ ] Create a parser with appropriate arguments\n",
    "   - [ ] Implement the main function\n",
    "   - [ ] Test the CLI functionality\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Problem: Rate limiting\n",

    "2. **Response Parsing Issues**:\n",

    "   - Solution: Add error handling for different response structures\n",
    "   - Problem: Empty or error responses\n",

    "## What to Submit\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your implementation of the chat scripts:\n",
    "   - Basic requirement: `utils/one_off_chat.py` for single prompt/response chat\n",
    "   - Stretch goal (optional): `utils/conversation.py` for contextual chat\n",
    "   - Testing script: `utils/test_chat.py` to evaluate your implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test results in `results/part_2/example.txt` with the following format:\n",
    "   - Usage examples section showing how to run your scripts\n",
    "   - Test results section with CSV-formatted question/response pairs\n",
    "   - If you implemented the stretch goal, include examples of contextual exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "The auto-grader should check:\n",
    "1. That your chat scripts can be executed\n",
    "2. That they correctly handle the test questions\n",
